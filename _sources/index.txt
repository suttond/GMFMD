What is this project for?
=========================

GeometricMD is an implementation of the Birkhoff curve shortening procedure using a technique devised by Schwetlick-Zimmer to compute local geodesics. It is currently implemented in Python using multiprocessing to distribute the computing.


How do I get set up?
=====================

Either use PIP with package name 'geometricmd' or run 'python setup.py install' after downloading the package from GitHub (suttond/GeometricMD).

Who do I talk to?
==================

* For questions about the project please contact Daniel Sutton (sutton.c.daniel@gmail.com)

* For scientific queries please contact Johannes Zimmer (zimmer@maths.bath.ac.uk)
